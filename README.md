# garden-view-cafe

WEB601 Project

This project is a web app designed for a fictional local cafe, "the Garden View Cafe" The project can be cloned from this repo and run on a local device, Git may need to be installed on that device to facilitate cloning and running.  Node.js will need to be installed and I would recomend using the VS Code text editor to view the code and run the Node.js commands.  Once a copy of the project is on the local device, open with VS Code (or equivilant) and run the command npm start, either from a terminal in the editor or from a diffrent terminal in the project folder directory to launch a version of the project to a local server.  This will then open the app in the local devices default browser.
